										<p> With Instant Apparel, our desire is to provide the first
											clothing-focused, same-day delivery service within the U.S.</p>
										Rising from a global pandemic, stores are adapting to in-store and curbside pickup, offering limited contact same-day pickup for orders placed online. This said, door-step delivery remains constrained by shipping systems that take days.</p>

												<h3>The Demand</h3>
												<p>Now more than ever, people are enticed by effortless pickup and delivery options. As food delivery services prove to be remarkably successful with a surprisingly large amount of interest, there is most certainly a market for the same service in other industries.</p>

											<div class="content">
												<h3>The Satisfaction</h3>
												<p>Orders will be delivered within a range of 1 to 4 hours. The customer will have a 24-hour window to decide if he or
													she is satisfied with their purchase. If not, they may choose to
													return through an Instant Apparel driver, free of charge.</p>

											<div class="content">
												<h3>The Speed</h3>
												<p>The fast delivery of Instant Apparel will get your clothing orders depends on a number of things. How far is the store? How bad is traffic? The average time is approximately 60 minutes but it could be more or less. Either way, you can track where your driver is on the Instant Apparel website or app.</p>

											<h3>INVESTOR'S STORY</h3>

											<h3>We’re Committed to the Safety and Wellbeing of Our Community</h3>
											<p>Over the past year, as cities and states have restricted the operations of retail stores and other businesses, we have heard mayors and governors call upon residents to use delivery and pick-up services to reduce person-to-person contact. The WHO has stated that there is no evidence of boxes and delivery packaging being associated with the transmission of COVID-19, but we remain vigilant in our actions to promote health and safety on our platform and to support IAers.</p>
